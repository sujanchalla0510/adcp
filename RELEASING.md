# Release Process

This is the operational overview for AdCP releases. For patch eligibility and
conflict policy, see `.agents/playbook.md` (§ Release lines). For the complete
maintenance-line checklist, see `.agents/shortcuts/cut-patch.md`.

## Current topology

- `3.1.x` is the stable maintenance line. Patch fixes are reviewed on `main`
  first, then cherry-picked to a PR targeting `3.1.x`.
- `main` is the next-minor line. It must be in Changesets beta pre mode
  (`.changeset/pre.json` with `"tag": "beta"`) while developing 3.2, so its
  Version Packages PRs produce `3.2.0-beta.N` rather than stable `3.2.0`.
- Forward merges are one-way: `3.1.x → main`. Never merge `main` into the
  maintenance branch.

The root `adcontextprotocol` package is private. Its version is release
metadata for Changesets and the protocol artifacts; it is **not published to
npm**. Protocol releases are distributed as signed tarballs through GitHub
Releases and `https://adcontextprotocol.org/protocol/`. SDK npm releases happen
in the separate `adcp-client` repository.

## Changes and changesets

Protocol changes need a changeset:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

Use `patch` for compatible fixes and clarifications, `minor` for additive
stable protocol surface, and `major` for breaking stable changes. Addie,
website, infrastructure, internal tooling, and non-normative docs do not get a
protocol changeset.

For a fix that must ship in 3.1.x:

1. Land the normal PR on `main`.
2. Confirm every protocol changeset in the merged commit is `patch`.
3. Create a clean branch from `origin/3.1.x`, cherry-pick the merged commit,
   resolve only maintenance-compatible conflicts, and open a PR to `3.1.x`.
4. Merge only after CI and human review. The push to `3.1.x` refreshes the
   `changeset-release/3.1.x` Version Packages PR.

Do not downgrade a `minor` or `major` changeset during a backport. Reclassify
the change on `main` first or leave it for 3.2.

## Cutting a 3.1.x patch

1. Audit `changeset-release/3.1.x`. The PR must show only
   `adcontextprotocol@3.1.X` under `Patch Changes`; unexpected non-protocol or
   higher-level entries are a stop.
2. Review the generated version, changelog, versioned schemas/compliance, and
   `dist/protocol/3.1.X.tgz{,.sha256,.sig,.crt}`.
3. Merge the Version Packages PR. `release.yml` tags `v3.1.X`, creates the
   GitHub Release, uploads the four assets, publishes the immutable artifacts
   to R2, and verifies the CDN copy. It does not run `npm publish`.
4. Let `release-docs.yml` open and merge the versioned docs snapshot PR.
5. Review and merge the automated forward-merge PR from `3.1.x` to `main`.
   Metadata may resolve by policy; content conflicts require human review.

## Patch verification (3.1.5 example)

Use the exact release version; do not verify through a moving alias:

```bash
VERSION=3.1.5

git fetch origin --tags
git rev-parse "v$VERSION^{}"
git rev-parse origin/3.1.x
gh release view "v$VERSION" --json tagName,targetCommitish,assets,url

tmpdir="$(mktemp -d)"
gh release download "v$VERSION" --dir "$tmpdir"
cd "$tmpdir"
shasum -a 256 -c "$VERSION.tgz.sha256"
cosign verify-blob \
  --signature "$VERSION.tgz.sig" \
  --certificate "$VERSION.tgz.crt" \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/adcontextprotocol/adcp/\.github/workflows/release\.yml@refs/heads/.*$' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer 'https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' \
  "$VERSION.tgz"

curl -fsSI "https://adcontextprotocol.org/protocol/$VERSION.tgz"
curl -fsS "https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/$VERSION/index.json" >/dev/null
curl -fsS "https://adcontextprotocol.org/compliance/$VERSION/index.json" >/dev/null
```

Then confirm:

- the tag and `origin/3.1.x` identify the Version Packages merge;
- the GitHub Release has exactly the tarball, checksum, signature, and
  certificate assets;
- `dist/docs/3.1.5/` lands on `main` and the `3.1` docs selector reflects it;
- the `3.1.x → main` forward-merge PR lands; and
- `git log v3.1.5..origin/3.1.x` contains no stranded release work.

## 3.2 beta pre mode

Enter beta pre mode on `main` before accepting 3.2 release changes:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
npx changeset pre enter beta
git add .changeset/pre.json
git commit -m "chore(release): enter pre mode for 3.2 beta"
```

Land that through a normal PR. While `.changeset/pre.json` exists, merge only
Version Packages PRs that resolve to `3.2.0-beta.N`. Keep pre mode and its
changeset pool on `main`; neither belongs on `3.1.x`. Exiting pre mode for 3.2
GA is a separate, explicitly reviewed release operation.

## Cutting a 3.2 release candidate

The first candidate is `3.2.0-rc.0`. Treat that promotion as a reviewed release
operation after the final beta, not as an ordinary Changesets tag switch.
Changesets increments the existing beta ordinal when its prerelease tag changes,
which would turn `beta.10` into `rc.11`. The repository's guarded promotion
script uses semver's phase-change behavior instead and refuses to run while any
changesets are still waiting for a final beta.

First merge the final beta Version Packages PR and verify its immutable assets.
Then, from a clean branch based on the resulting `main`:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
npm run promote:rc -- --check
npm run promote:rc -- --prepare
git diff --check
git add .changeset/pre.json .changeset/rc-promotion.json
git commit -m "chore(release): prepare 3.2.0-rc.0"
```

Open and merge that state-only commit as its own PR. The release workflow sees
the marker, creates the Version Packages PR at `3.2.0-rc.0`, and generates and
signs the normal schema, compliance, and protocol artifacts in GitHub Actions.
That generated PR must receive human approval on its final head SHA. Do not run
`changeset version` for this one phase-transition, and do not hand-edit the
package version, lockfile, prerelease state, marker, or generated artifacts.

The script is intentionally one-way and 3.2-specific: it requires `beta.N`,
beta pre mode, and an empty root changeset pool; computes `3.2.0-rc.0`; and
prepares the reviewed marker and `rc` pre state. The Version Packages workflow
updates the package and lockfile through `npm version`, consumes the marker, and
adds a phase-only RC.0 changelog entry before building the release artifacts.
Any fixes after RC.0 use ordinary changesets and the normal Version Packages
flow to produce `rc.1`, `rc.2`, and so on.

Before merging the RC Version Packages PR, confirm:

- the package and lockfile resolve to `3.2.0-rc.N`, and `.changeset/pre.json`
  still has `"mode": "pre"` and `"tag": "rc"`;
- the changelog contains only changes intended for the candidate;
- versioned schemas, compliance bundles, protocol tarball, checksum,
  signature, and certificate all use that exact RC version;
- the compact lifecycle storyboards and training-agent profile tests pass;
- the TypeScript, Python, Go, and Java SDK disposition is recorded, with any
  unsupported SDK called out rather than silently implied ready; and
- open 3.2 milestone items are either closed or explicitly moved out of the
  release by their decision owner.

After merge, verify the exact immutable release rather than a moving alias:

```bash
VERSION=3.2.0-rc.0

git fetch origin --tags
git rev-parse "v$VERSION^{}"
gh release view "v$VERSION" --json tagName,isPrerelease,targetCommitish,assets,url
curl -fsS "https://adcontextprotocol.org/schemas/$VERSION/index.json" >/dev/null
curl -fsS "https://adcontextprotocol.org/compliance/$VERSION/index.json" >/dev/null
curl -fsSI "https://adcontextprotocol.org/protocol/$VERSION.tgz"
```

Also confirm the release is marked prerelease, has exactly the tarball and
three sidecars, the `3.2-rc` docs snapshot lands, and the public training agent
advertises and executes the exact RC version. Subsequent fixes get ordinary
changesets and advance to the next `rc.N` through the Version Packages PR.

For 3.2 stable, use a separate reviewed state change:

```bash
npx changeset pre exit
```

The resulting Version Packages PR removes the prerelease suffix. Do not
re-enter another tag before that stable versioning step.

## Recovery

If the automated release fails after the Version Packages merge, fix and
rerun the workflow when safe. Manual tag/release recovery is the last resort:
the tag must target the Version Packages merge, and the same four signed
assets must be uploaded without overwriting an existing artifact with a
different digest. See `.agents/shortcuts/cut-major.md` for the fallback
commands.
